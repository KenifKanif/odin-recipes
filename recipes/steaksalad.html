        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The juicy rib-eye steak is pan-seared to absolute perfection. It doesn't get any better than this. <p>(And I'll share the secret of how easy it is to create this masterpiece steak.)</p>
            
            </li>
            <li>Peppery Arugula</li>
            <li>Avocados</li>
            <li>Sweet Cherry Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Crunchy Cucumbers</li>
            <li>Balsamic vinaigrette and dijon mustard</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lets Make Some Steak</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Season your steak well. I've listed 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the ingredient list, but you could double this. The first time I had a really well-seasoned steak, my mind was blown. It makes all the difference.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Cook the steak in a blazing hot pan. If you have a cast iron pan, use it. I set mine on the element on high heat and don't put the steak in the pan until it's smoking like mad. This crazy high heat is what gives the steak a gorgeous char without overcooking it.</p></li>
            <li><p>And because you're using such high heat, oil the steak instead of the pan.</p></li>
            <li><p>Make sure the steak you buy is at least 3/4 inch thick. More is better.</p></li>
        </ol>
