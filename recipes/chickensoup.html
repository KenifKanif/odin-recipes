    <h1>Simple Chicken Soup</h1>

    <h3>Tastes like home</h3>
       <p>This comfort food classic is just as flavorful and soul-satisfying as Grandma's chicken soup, but where hers took several hours-or a day-to make, ours takes under an hour. </p>
       <p>Instead of long-simmered stock, we start with store-bought chicken broth and water but enrich them with stock vegetables and the carcass, bones and meat of a leftover roast chicken.</p>
